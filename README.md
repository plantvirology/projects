## Usage

### Creating a new project 

To create a new project, create a copy of the "project_template" folder and rename it to something identifiable. 

### Required project files
Each project needs a project description file (project.info) that provides basic details about the main people involved in this project so far and the aims etc. This should give enough detail to encourage others to collaborate with you on the project.
